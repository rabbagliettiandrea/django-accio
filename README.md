What is Accio?
--------------

Accio is just a missing bridge that connects the marvellous *django* with the fabulous *celery*, provinding a nice django-admin interface and some killer-features (like holding in a Redis store the async log!).

Why did you choose the name Accio
--------------
I'm from the South Italy. Here *accio* stands for *celery*, in local dialect :)
