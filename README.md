What is Accio?
--------------
Accio is just the missing bridge that connects the marvellous [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) with the fabulous [celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/),
providing a nice django-admin interface and some killer-features (like **holding in a Redis store the async log!**).

Why did you choose the name Accio?
----------------------------------
I'm from the South Italy. Here *accio* stands for *celery*, in local dialect :)
